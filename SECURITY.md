Only the docker image with the latest version of GHC is supported with security
updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in the latest docker image, email the maintainer
olivier.benz@b-data.ch.

Vulnerabilities in docker images with prior versions of GHC are not fixed.

Whenever a new version of GHC is released, the previous version's docker image
is rebuilt once again and then frozen.
